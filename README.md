Ongoing research and development into bitcoin software management systems. http://bankon.me is an attempt to create a secure, private and anonymous operating system to facilitate the purchase of goods and services. Early work with bitcoin-0.7.2 alpha has proven frustrating. Currently bankon.me is running bitcoin-0.8.1 and bitcoin-0.8.6 on Debian Linux 6.0.9. Currently with Debian issues have arisen with the verion of the C compiler. Building a second C compiler from source needs better documentation. Recently it is advised to upgrade to bitcoin-0.9.1. Documentation is in the works. As of this moment 20140415 I have downloaded 82% of the blockchain. Including the blockchain as part of the operating system seems a lucrative way to save bandwidth. Indeed, bankonme is a value added service added to Debian Linux. Explorating is continuing with OpenBSD as a canidate for bitcoin banking. Ultamitely a dual boot environment is being pursued. All works are GPL, BSD and MIT licenced where applicable. http://bankon.me donates 51% of net profit to open source projects. When you want results, go to the source.
